# CIS-30A-Final-Keylogger-

Keylogging is, as the name suggests, the action of recording the keys entered on the keyboard on a computer. Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Write a keylogger program that records the user input. You can use the Pynput library to control and monitor input devices such as mouse and keyboard. Additionally, you can use Listener API and Pythoncan to read data buffer and create log files of data that has been input by the users.


## Requirements:
- The program should entice the user to enter information.
- The program should record keyboard input and save input information to a text file.
- The program should output a text file that contains input information from the user.
- The program should contain the following components:
    - Include comments throughout the program (10 points)
    - Use variables and list to store and access data. You can use tuple or dictionary in place of a list (20 points)
    - Use string object to display and control text output. (10 points)
    - Define 2 or more functions and use function calls to execute tasks in the program. (20 points)
    - Implement loop (for or while or both) (10 points)
    - Include conditional statement (if or if-else or if-elif-else) (10 points)
    - Use a non-built-in module, custom module. (20 points)
    - Contains at least 2 classes and 1 sub-class (20 points)
    - Includes 1 or more objects and 1 or more methods in each class. (20 points)
    - Implement error detection using Python built-in exceptions. (10 points)
    - Implement file operations and file output. (20 points)
    - Integrate UI (optional): Bonus 30 points

## Goals:
This program aims to increase awareness about keylogging and allow users to see their typing and mouse movement history.
## 

### Strengths:
  - Shows exactly what it's tracking
  - Easy-to-use interface
  - Doesn't use info for anything
  - Shows real time tracking

### Weaknesses:
  - Can accidentally take sensitive info
  - Doesn't give users any reason to type
  - Can feel invasive

### Future Improvements:
  - Data Sorting
  - Data Encryption
  - Prompting Users to Type
